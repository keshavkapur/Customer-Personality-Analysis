# Customer-Personality-Analysis
The Customer Personality Analysis in Tableau project aims to understand customer behavior by analyzing demographic and purchasing data. The insights from this analysis help businesses create targeted marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and boost sales.

## Key Objectives:
- Segment customers based on demographics, spending habits, and preferences.
- Identify high-value customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
- Analyze factors influencing customer engagement and churn.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for business growth.

## Key insights into customer behavior:
- High-Value Customers: Customers with higher income and frequent purchases contribute significantly to revenue.
- Personalized loyalty programs can improve retention.
- Customer Segmentation: Different segments have varying spending habits—young professionals prefer online shopping, while older customers may favor in-store purchases.
- Churn Risk Identification: Customers with low engagement in recent months are at risk of churn. Offering exclusive discounts or targeted marketing can re-engage them.
- Marketing Strategies: Premium product recommendations for high-income groups.

## KPIs for Customer Personality Analysis
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) – Measures the total revenue a business can expect from a customer over their lifetime.
- Average Purchase Frequency – The average number of purchases per customer in a given period.
- Recency (RFM Analysis) – Days since the last purchase to identify engaged vs. inactive customers.
- Customer Segmentation Distribution – Breakdown of customer segments (e.g., high-value, occasional, new customers).
- Churn Rate – Percentage of customers who have stopped engaging over a period.
- Average Order Value (AOV) – Total revenue divided by the number of orders.

## Final Recommendation:
- Businesses should adopt data-driven marketing strategies to optimize customer retention and increase profitability.
- Regular monitoring of customer behavior and adapting strategies accordingly can ensure long-term success.
